Comments:
1. Separate .scss modules are breaking SCF principle, but increasing readability and maintainability
2. Services layer for now is redundant and exist only for future extension

TODOS:
1. Invalidate cache in transport layer
2. Add tests
3. Decide if user service should be a singleton
4. Add comments
5. Decide if it's possible to use some kind of services composition (without writing another framework)
